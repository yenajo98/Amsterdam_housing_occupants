# Amsterdam_housing_occupants


When I was living in Amsterdam, I had always wondered about where would be the best place to live in Amsterdam. Since Amsterdam is so beautiful but also very expensive (especially the places I think most beautiful), I wanted to find out whether that’s really the case or not. My top 3 places in minds are DePijp, Jordan, and Vondelpark areas. 

I did this analysis out of my own curiosity, but this has allowed me to learn a lot of coding skills thinking/ and decision-making skills along the way. 

I was so happy because the analysis proved my hypothesis. People who are single like me prefer those top 3 places the most, especially DePijp and Jordaan areas. So it wasn’t only me who thought those places were beautiful. There are many cute and hip cafes and old buildings, which are types of houses people typically think of when they think about Amsterdam.

This analysis has also got me more questions. Since the places people are living in terms of occupant types were very different, I wanted to know about their average age and more detailed information about each neighborhood. I hope I can find the information on those things for my future analysis so that I can incorporate new findings on my first Amsterdam housing analysis.
